# Lipid Genomic Metabolic Models Annotator Lipid_GEMA
## Description 

One of the key challenges in lipid analysis is the absence of comprehensive annotations for GSM models with defined structural representations. This gap limits the ability to validate and correlate experimental data with the lipid models under investigation. Lipid_GEMA aims to overcome this hurdle by offering a powerful annotation framework tailored specifically for these models.

Lipid_GEMA is a powerful annotation tool designed to streamline lipid analysis and annotation processes. Built with a comprehensive database utilizing Lipid Maps and Swiss Lipids information, this tool combines python algorithm with extensive lipid knowledge to provide accurate and efficient annotations.
At his core lies a robust graph database meticulously constructed to store a complex collection of lipid data. Leveraging the rich resources provided by Lipid Maps and Swiss Lipids, the database emcompasses a wide range of lipid entities, ensure comprehensive coverage across various lipid classes, subtypes, and structural variations. 

The Python pipeline employed by Lipid_GEMA serves as a critical component, enabling seamless connectivity between the user and the database. Through advanced matching techniques, the algorithm efficiently identifies and retrieves relevant lipid information from the database. Moreover this information is then used to perform the annotation of structurally defined lipids facilitating accurate mapping and validation of lipidomics data.
