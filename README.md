# Lipid Genomic Metabolic Models Annotator Lipid_GEMA
## Description 

One of the key challenges in lipid analysis is the absence of comprehensive annotations for GSM models with defined structural representations. This gap limits the ability to validate and correlate experimental data with the lipid models under investigation. Lipid_GEMA aims to overcome this hurdle by offering a powerful annotation framework tailored specifically for these models.

Lipid_GEMA is a powerful annotation tool designed to streamline lipid analysis and annotation processes. Built with a comprehensive database utilizing Lipid Maps and Swiss Lipids information, this tool combines python algorithm with extensive lipid knowledge to provide accurate and efficient annotations.

At the core of Lipid_GEMA lies a robust graph database meticulously constructed to store a complex collection of lipid data. Leveraging the rich resources provided by Lipid Maps and Swiss Lipids, the database emcompasses a wide range of lipid entities, ensure comprehensive coverage across various lipid classes, subtypes, and structural variations.
